## About

This is a stripped-down version of the original Compose Text Editor, focused **entirely on Desktop (JVM)**.  
All Android components have been removed for better compatibility in **pure Compose Desktop projects**.

It also includes a critical fix to prevent crashes when the cursor is placed beyond the bounds of the text layout.

## Based on

Original Project:  
üëâ [darkrockstudios/texteditor](https://github.com/Wavesonics/ComposeTextEditorLibrary)  
MIT-licensed by **Adam Brown**

Modifications and Desktop-only version maintained by **CrowdWare**  
GPL-3 licensed additions

## Why?

The original project is an impressive attempt at re-implementing a rich text editor from scratch to overcome the limitations of `BasicTextField` in Compose.

This fork was created to:

- Use the editor **independently of Android**
- Avoid dependency issues related to AGP and Android Studio versions
- Provide better stability and control in Desktop-only Compose environments

---

## Why ‚ÄúNoCode‚Äù if there‚Äôs code?
NoCodeDesigner empowers users to build apps without writing code ‚Äì but for advanced use cases, 
we provide a fallback: a clean and structured editor for our own markup language (SML). 
Think of it as LowCode under a NoCode umbrella ‚Äî enabling power users without losing 
simplicity for beginners.

---

## What‚Äôs Working

- Rich text rendering & editing
- Cursor movement, selection, copy/cut/paste
- Efficient layout: only visible lines are rendered
- Scroll handling
- Supports custom span rendering (e.g., spell check underlines)
- Emits fine-grained edit events for real-time processing

---

## Platforms

‚úÖ Supported: **JVM/Desktop**  
‚ùå Removed: Android, Web, WASM (to avoid AGP and Gradle plugin issues)

---
